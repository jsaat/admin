# Why a New Journal?

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for researchers to revise the 
piblications  bonds which have connected them with one another, and to assume among the 
publication powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the 
Laws of Entropy and our Natural Intellect entitle them, a decent respect of the opinions of 
huamnkind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

Accordingly, in this document, we motivate the need for a new kind of journal with:

- *Micro papers* TBD
- Open review
- Minimal, open source, infrastructure. We contend that given the existance of the Internet; open source version control systems that are now in widespread use (e.g. Github); ready access to public domains paper archives (arxiv.org);  paper indexing systems  (Google Scholar, which feeds from arxiv.org) then the mechanics of managing a journal can be achieved using a very small set of tiny scripts. By developing open source versions of these scripts we can take advtange of innovation at Internet speed where others improve our tools. 

Another advantage of such an open source minimal infrastructure is that if others do not like the journal we create, they can build there own. Thus our journal could still *fail* while still succeedings wFurther, the existance of these 




## Pace of Change

Currently publication processes in the software engineering research community
are complicated by several factors

### An initial lack of good journal venues for SE papers.###

Vcitor Basili (personnel communication) recalls a time in the 1960s were standard computer science journals made little space for these new kind of papers on software engineering. In respnse, SE researchers required **mega-papers* for  their conferences. very long papers, papers that had to be complete units of well evaluated research) which, in turn, forced any SE journal venue to demand papers even more complex than those seen in conferences.

### Slow pace of change in tools, conclusions###

### Hard for Industry Involement ### 

The PIs of this proposal have
frequent contact with a very large industrial community engaged in software innovation. These developers
at Raleigh, Seattle, and Silicon Valley are responsible for innovations that have changed how software is
developed and how we interact with that software (e.g. the iPhone interface from Apple; agile and opensource
development practices and tools such as GitHub; exabyte-level cloud storage; industrial mega-scale
data mining at Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft; etc). A common complaint we hear from those innovative
developers is that academic software engineering papers published in conferences and journals are irrelevant
and removed from their needs, interests, and results.

Hence, we propose removing the barriers that block our industrial partners from participating in academic forums.
We will shorten the format of research papers so industrial developers may have enough time to write them.
This will increase the currency of our research papers by decreasing their review times.|

(Aside: it might appear that current journals support “short” in their current call for papers. However,
speaking as authors who have tried to make that kind of submission, we report that short papers are rare at
senior journals like IEEE TSE. Reviewers often reject the shorter paper, demanding more details. The PIs
have several such papers that started out as as simple clear comments on prior work but, after literally years
of rewrites and resubmissions, they appeared as very long papers.)

### Paid publication venues###

According to the
Whitehouse Office of Science and Technology, "citizens deserve easy access to the results of scientific
research their tax dollars have paid for" (http://goo.gl/wlMKP). Yet much of the results of scientific research
are being locked away behind paywalls. The fee-for-service publishing houses boast exorbitantly large profit
margins for the publications of our papers: mean figures from Elsevier, Springer, and John Wiley & Sons
over the last decade range from 33 to 42% [115, 130]). ACM and IEEE, while not for profit, are likewise
fee-for-service. These costs are increasing. For example, at Harvard University, prices for content from two
providers have increased by about 145% over the past six years, which exceeds not only the consumer price
index, but also the higher education and the library price indices [26]

### Loss of control over innovation at journals###
We staff the editorial boards. We even train the next generation of researchers to write the next generation
of papers. Nevertheless, even though we generate and moderate the content of our publications, we cannot
change even small details on how that content is collected and disseminated. 

Here is a small example of this widespread
problem: In 2010, the PIs were part of a team of half a dozen prominent SE researchers that tried to convince
three leading SE journals to change their “short paper” policy. The proposed change was that “papers under
4 pages will be reviewed in one month”. This proposed change was motivated by a desire to (1) increase the
currency of recent publications; (2) engage more with our industrial colleagues who find it easy to contribute
to such a shorter format. The proposal was discussed, at length, with the editors of the ASE journal, IEEE
TSE, and EMSE (Bashar Nuseibeh, Lionel Briand, Robert Hall). Those editors expressed interest in the
idea but commented they were unable to effect that kind of editorial change without clearing it with the
publisher. In the end, this proposal was never implemented, despite the interest expressed by those editors
and despite the ardent advocacy of prominent and active SE researchers. 

This is a troubling story. As SE researchers, we volunteer our labor to write, review, and edit the papers. Clearly, it is time for a change
